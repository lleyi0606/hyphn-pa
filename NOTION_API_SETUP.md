# Notion API Integration Setup

This document explains how to set up the Notion API integration for the Hyphn PA Bot.

## Environment Variables

The bot requires the following environment variables to be set:

### NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN

Your Notion integration token (starts with `ntn_`).

**Note:** This token should be kept secret and stored in environment variables only.

This token allows the bot to access your Notion workspace and read from the Hyphn Competitions database.

### NOTION_DATABASE_ID

The ID of the Hyphn Competitions database:
```
291a59e7892d802c829bcf5ecc0675dc
```

This is extracted from the database URL: `https://www.notion.so/291a59e7892d802c829bcf5ecc0675dc`

## Vercel Environment Variables

To deploy this bot on Vercel, add these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
3. Add the following variables:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` | Your Notion integration token (starts with `ntn_`) |
| `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` | `291a59e7892d802c829bcf5ecc0675dc` |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Your Telegram bot token |
| `MANUS_API_KEY` | Your Manus API key (for /manusadd command) |

## Implementation Details

The bot uses the official `@notionhq/client` package to interact with the Notion API. The integration:

1. Connects to Notion using the integration token
2. Queries the database to retrieve all competition entries
3. Parses the database properties into a structured Competition object
4. Provides filtering and analysis capabilities for the Telegram bot commands

## Testing

To test the integration locally:

1. Create a `.env` file with the required environment variables
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
3. Send commands to your Telegram bot

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Verify that the Notion integration has access to the Hyphn Competitions database
2. Check that the environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure the database ID matches the actual database in your Notion workspace
4. Review the bot logs for any error messages
